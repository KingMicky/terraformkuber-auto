# terraformkuber-auto

## Overview

`terraformkuber-auto` is a project that combines the power of Terraform and Kubernetes for automating infrastructure provisioning and management. It is designed to streamline the process of deploying and managing resources on Kubernetes clusters using Terraform configurations.

## Features

- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Leverage Terraform's declarative syntax to define and provision infrastructure on various cloud providers or on-premises environments.

- **Kubernetes Automation:** Simplify the deployment and management of applications on Kubernetes clusters using Terraform modules specifically tailored for Kubernetes resources.

- **Customization:** Easily adapt the Terraform configurations to your specific infrastructure requirements, ensuring flexibility and scalability.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) installed on your local machine.
- Access to a Kubernetes cluster (local, cloud-based, or on-premises).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
 ```bash
 git clone https://github.com/your-username/terraformkuber-auto.git
 cd terraformkuber-auto
```
Customize the Terraform configurations in the terraform/ directory according to your infrastructure needs.

Initialize Terraform:

  ```bash
terraform init

```
Deploy the infrastructure:
  ```bash
terraform apply
```
Usage
Modify the Terraform configurations in the terraform/ directory to add or adjust resources.

Apply the changes:
```bash
terraform apply
```
Tear down the infrastructure when it's no longer needed:
```bash
terraform destroy
```
